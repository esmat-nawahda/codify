# Codify 🚀🎉
"Because there's nothing scarier than your own code!"

Codify is a TypeScript library that helps you analyze your code for readability, maintainability, complexity, and more. It's like a spellchecker for your code, but instead of finding spelling mistakes, it finds coding issues!

## Features 🎁
Design Analyzer: Checks your code for adherence to good design principles.
Complexity Analyzer: Calculates the cyclomatic complexity of your code.
Duplication Analyzer: Finds duplicate code that may have been unintentionally copied.
Refactor Analyzer: Suggests parts of your code that may need refactoring.

## Installation 🚀
Use the package manager npm to install codify.

```bash
npm install codify
```

## Usage 📖
Here's how you use Codify to analyze some TypeScript code:

```javascript
import { analyzeDesign, analyzeComplexity, analyzeDuplication, analyzeRefactoring } from 'codify';

const code = `
  function foo(bar) {
    var a = 'hello world';
    return a + bar;
  }

  function foo(bar) {
    var a = 'hello world';
    return a + bar;
  }
`;

console.log(analyzeDesign(code));
console.log(analyzeComplexity(code));
console.log(analyzeDuplication(code));
console.log(analyzeRefactoring(code));
```
